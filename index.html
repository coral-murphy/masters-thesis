            <p> On a warm January evening, Wanda Arzuaga López made her way through a neighborhood in southeastern Juncos, Puerto Rico, as               she campaigned for the position of the town’s next mayor. She made her way sporting a light blue polo, silver hoop earrings,                 and a white canvas tote adorned with the message of her campaign principles, which also happens to be her party’s name:                       Proyecto Dignindad, or The Dignity Project, in English.</p>

            </figure>


            <p> Joined by her campaign director and four dedicated volunteers, Arzuaga López goes door-to-door, warmly exclaiming, 
              “Hi there! May God bless your family!” in a sector where the majority of residents, most of them above their 50s, 
              have borne the brunt of living near a waste disposal facility nestled within Puerto Rico’s lush greenery.

            <p>For Arzuaga López, the hardships endured by the people in her hometown extend far beyond the acrid air. She aims to connect with potential voters disenchanted by Puerto Rico's current political landscape. Politicians promise economic upheaval, but younger generations are instead met with an empty job market, causing many to flee to the U.S. and leave the island bereft of talent. When disaster strikes, building back better is replaced with privatization, political corruption, and constant power outages. </p>

            
            <p>Economic challenges disproportionately impact low-income communities in Puerto Rico where over 40 percent of the island's 3.2 million inhabitants live below the poverty line, exacerbated by the devastating aftermath of Hurricane María in 2017. The island’s population declined more than 11% from 2010 to 2020. For the mayoral hopeful in Juncos, this is why more than half of the town's eligible voters abstained from participating in the mayoral election in 2020.  </p>

            
             <p>With economic, political, and environmental woes coming at Puerto Ricans from all sides, the pendulum is swinging to the right with the help from the church - an institution that has supported residents when politicians failed to deliver help after disaster hits. </p>

            <p>The party's growing presence can be felt on the ballot. In 2020, the right-wing party debuted with 29 candidates running for positions including the governor, mayor, local Senate, and House seats. Four years later, that number has spiked to 401.</p>
            
            <p>The emergence of Proyecto Dignidad reflects broader trends of populism, nationalism, and anti-establishment sentiment observed in Latin America and globally, with each movement taking strategies from Donald Trump's playbook and adapting to its country's specific context and challenges. If elected in November, members of Proyecto Dignidad aim to criminalize women who perform or consent to an abortion, remove vaccination requirements at public schools, and defend “conversion therapy” for LGBTQ people. </p>
            
            <p>Traditionally a two-party system, Puerto Rico's political discourse was disrupted when a non-elected fiscal control board, imposed by former President Barack Obama, eroded the island's autonomy. About a year later, Hurricane Maria devastated the island, causing enduring issues like a fragile power grid and frequent outages, aggravated by the pandemic and austerity measures.  </p>

            <p>Corruption, Puerto Rico’s much too often plague du jour, was pronounced most acutely in 2019, when the island garnered international attention after thousands of protesters demonstrated in the streets of San Juan calling for the resignation of former governor Ricardo Rosselló. Amidst this turmoil, Proyecto Dignidad, a conservative party, has gained traction.</p>
            
            <p>The church, once confined to private life, is now a political force dictating policies and reshaping community dynamics. Arzuaga López, a chaplain at a local church, remembers when she helped her mother sue the water authority for its inefficient service to residents living in mountainous, hard-to-reach areas in the early 2000s. </p>
            
            <p>Proyecto Dignidad, the political party at the forefront of this shift, is actively canvassing often-neglected municipalities. Women, teenagers, and pastors are convening at local plazas to hear how Proyecto Dignidad strives to eradicate Puerto Rico’s financial distress and high criminality rates, issues of pressing concern all over the island, while promising to reverse policy that allows abortions in Puerto Rico and protects the rights of the LGBTQ+ communities. Issues, generally, unwelcomed by the many Puerto Ricans of Catholic and Protestant faith.  </p>
            
            <p>The incumbent mayor of Juncos, a white-mustached man bearing the nickname “Papo,” was picked by only 23 percent of eligible voters. He belongs to the Popular Democratic Party, which has historically advocated for Puerto Rico’s commonwealth status, or what locals call “the status quo.” It’s also what others call a colonial limbo. </p>

          <div class="col-12 col-md-8 col-lg-6">
            
            <p>In the 2020 elections, Proyecto Dignidad unexpectedly secured two conservative female lawmakers, focusing on anti-abortion, anti-gender education, and anti-street harassment policies. Four years later, the Christian party is substantially much stronger and plans to secure even more spots in government by backing conservative causes.  </p>
            
            <p>Proyecto Dignidad, along with its progressive counterpart Movimiento Victoria Ciudadana, has been resonating with voters by focusing on rebuilding Puerto Rico and offering a vision for the future that appeals to young people, moving away from the statehood question.  </p>

            <p>The conservative party saw a ninefold surge in donations their second time around, raising over $24,440 by mid-March, a hefty jump from the $2,370 they garnered by the same period in 2020, during their initial debut.</p>

            
             <p>A recent poll conducted by the main newspaper, El Nuevo Día, captured this sentiment. When asked about their expectations for the performance of third parties in the upcoming November elections, 78% of respondents expressed confidence in their ability to make a significant impact. Another poll shows an increase in favorability for Proyecto Dignidad from Nov. 2023 to March 2024.</p>

            <p>“Amidst a scenario of economic erosion, as well as the weakening of traditional political parties that have remained in power, Proyecto Dignidad and Movimiento Victoria Ciudadana start to emerge,” said Juan Caraballo Resto, an anthropology professor at the University of Puerto Rico who focuses on the intersection of religion and politics. </p>

             <p> But Proyecto Dignidad didn’t emerge overnight. The traditional party advocating for statehood, the New Progressive Party (PNP, in Spanish), has historically attracted religious sectors on the island. For instance, consider the "religious liberty bill" proposed by the ousted former governor Ricardo Rosselló in 2019, which sought to exempt government employees from serving constituents if their religious beliefs clashed. International superstar Ricky Martin, a Puerto Rican native, had to write a letter to garner national support, attracting figures like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, eventually leading to the bill's demise. Still, a substantial number of people on the island supported the bill—individuals whom Proyecto Dignidad is now reaching out to.</p>
            
             <p> “For many years now, religiously conservative coalitions have been closely linked to a group of legislators, mayors, and leaders who have tried to lobby for bills," Caraballo Resto said. “Proyecto Dignidad is the result of a historical evolution raised by religious leaders, their interests, and conservative Christians on the island.” </p>
            
             <p> One potential success for Proyecto Dignidad could be in San Sebastian, a rural northwestern town, where they might secure their first mayoral seat. Javier Jiménez, the current mayor, disaffiliated from the traditional party advocating for statehood, and is now running for governor under Proyecto Dignidad’s banner. </p>
            
             <p>His endorsement of the mayoral candidate aligned with Proyecto Dignidad is likely to have a significant impact. </p>
             <p>Jimenez gained recognition for swiftly restoring power to San Sebastian after Hurricane Maria amid FEMA’s slow response. He mobilized a task force named the Pepino Power Authority, after the city’s official name, San Sebastián de las Vegas del Pepino. He staffed it by reassigning 32 licensed electricians from the town’s workforce. Instead of applause, he faced accusations from The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority of circumventing its monopoly. FEMA later released a public statement applauding his efforts, reminding Puerto Ricans two months after the natural disaster that “You are the help until help arrives.” </p>
            
             <p>“The government didn’t do its job,” Jiménez said on a warm January day, sitting on a bench in San Sebastian’s plaza.  </p>
            
             <p>That was a pivotal moment for Jimenez. He grew distrustful of his own party, despising the direction the education system was taking with gender perspective, as well as mask mandates following the pandemic, the right to abortion, and a slew of other beliefs.</p>
            
             <p>“The PNP has distanced itself from its principles and the value for life that I treasure,” he said.</p>
            
             <p>He made the switch, although his chances of winning for governor under Proyecto Dignidad were slim. Still, his influence is certain to leave a mark, particularly considering the recent 37% slump in new voter registrations reported in February compared to the same period in the previous election year. </p>
            
            <p>Camilo Ortiz, once the pro-statehood New Progressive Party’s vice president, announced his departure from the party and his candidacy for mayor of San Sebastian under Proyecto Dignidad. He garnered the support of Jimenez, one of Puerto Rico’s most popular mayors. </p>
            <p>“We need to put the house in order,” he said. “Until we do that, we can’t aspire for any change in our status.”  </p>
