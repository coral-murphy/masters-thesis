            <p> On a warm January evening, Wanda Arzuaga López made her way through a neighborhood in southeastern Juncos, 
              Puerto Rico, as she campaigned for the position of the town’s next mayor.
            </p>
            <p> Sporting a light blue polo, silver hoop earrings, and a white canvas tote adorned with the message of 
              her campaign principles, which also happens to be her party’s name: Proyecto Dignindad, 
              or The Dignity Project, in English.

            </figure>


            <p> Joined by her campaign director and four dedicated volunteers, Arzuaga López goes door-to-door, warmly exclaiming, 
              “Hi there! May God bless your family!” in a sector where the majority of residents, most of them above their 50s, 
              have borne the brunt of living near a waste disposal facility nestled within Puerto Rico’s lush greenery.

            <p>Journalistic conventions vary by country. In the United States, journalism is produced by media organizations or by individuals. Bloggers are often, but not always, journalists. The Federal Trade Commission requires that bloggers who write about products received as promotional gifts to disclose that they received the products for free. This is intended to eliminate conflicts of interest and protect consumers.</p>
            <p>According to Robert McChesney, healthy journalism in a democratic country must provide an opinion of people in power and who wish to be in power, must include a range of opinions and must regard the informational needs of all people.</p>

            <p>There are several forms of journalism with diverse audiences. Thus, journalism is said to serve the role of a "fourth estate", acting as a watchdog on the workings of the government. A single publication (such as a newspaper) contains many forms of journalism, each of which may be presented in different formats. Each section of a newspaper, magazine, or website may cater to a different audience.</p>
            <p>Consequently, this has resulted in arguments to reconsider journalism as a process distributed among many authors, including the socially mediating public, rather than as individual products and articles written by dedicated journalists.</p>
            <p>Because of these changes, the credibility ratings of news outlets has reached an all-time low. A 2014 study revealed that only 22% of Americans reported a "great deal" or "quite a lot of confidence" in either television news or newspapers.</p>
