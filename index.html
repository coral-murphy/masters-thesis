            <p>On a warm January evening, Wanda Arzuaga López made her way through a neighborhood in southeastern Juncos, Puerto Rico, joined by her campaign director and four dedicated volunteers, Arzuaga López went door-to-door, warmly exclaiming, “Hi there! May God bless your family!” as she campaigned for the position of the town’s next mayor. </p>

            <p>She canvassed in a sector where the majority of residents, most of them above their 50s, have borne the brunt of living near a waste disposal facility nestled within Puerto Rico’s lush greenery, inhaling rancid fumes. People peered out their windows first, then walked out the door all at once. “Who are you?” quickly turned into another kind of dump, with potential voters badmouthing the current government and the abandonment they felt after the wreck left by natural disasters. </p>

            <p>For Arzuaga López, the hardships endured by the people in her hometown extend far beyond the acrid air which swirls with a strange mixture of the earthy scent of decomposing leaves and rotting food scraps. </p>

            <p>She aims to connect with potential voters disenchanted by Puerto Rico's current political landscape. </p>

            <p>Politicians promise economic upheaval, but younger generations are instead met with an empty job market, causing many to flee to the U.S. — an easily achievable move as Puerto Ricans can travel freely between the mainland and Puerto Rico without a passport – and leave the island bereft of talent. When disaster strikes, infrastructure improvements are replaced with privatization, political corruption, and constant power outages.</p>

            <p>With economic, political, and environmental woes coming at Puerto Ricans from all sides, the pendulum is swinging to the right with the help from the church - an institution that has supported residents when politicians failed to deliver help after disaster hits. It’s not uncommon for houses of worship to respond swiftly to crises, often outpacing emergency services by providing those affected by hurricanes or earthquakes with essentials such as food, water, clothing, and shelter. It also helps that church members are already well-known neighbors. </p>

            <p>It's that quick response that residents want from their politicians and those receiving an endorsement from the church are now being seen as a political savior by many. </p>

            <p>Proyecto Dignidad, the political party at the forefront of this shift, is actively canvassing often-neglected municipalities, adding a lot more faces to their roster in the upcoming elections. </p>

            <p>Women, teenagers, and pastors are convening at local plazas to hear how Proyecto Dignidad strives to eradicate Puerto Rico’s financial distress and high criminality rates, issues of pressing concern all over the island, while promising to reverse policy that allows abortions in Puerto Rico and protects the rights of the LGBTQ+ communities. Issues, generally, unwelcomed by the many Puerto Ricans of Catholic and Protestant faith. </p>

            <p>​​”I’ve been working with a school here to offer ​​workshops related to values,” Arzuaga López said. “We’re using people from within Proyecto Dignidad to help.” </p>

            <p>And to many rural community members, people like Arzuaga López are familiar faces in the area – longtime friends they can count on. One disaster after another, when politicians failed to step up, the church did. </p>

            <p>“Whenever there’s been an initiative where I can help the community, I’ve always gotten involved with my ecclesiastical church,” Arzuaga López said. “We did it after the hurricanes and after the earthquakes, when we traveled to Guayanilla to distribute resources.” </p>

            <p>The church, once confined to private life, is now a political force dictating policies and reshaping community dynamics. </p>

            <p>Arzuaga López, a chaplain at a local church, remembers when she helped her mother sue the water authority for its inefficient service to residents living in mountainous, hard-to-reach areas in the early 2000s.</p>

            <p>Battles like these are much too common in the U.S. territory. </p>

            <p>Economic challenges disproportionately impact low-income communities in Puerto Rico, where over 40 percent of the island's 3.3 million inhabitants live below the poverty line, exacerbated by the devastating aftermath of Hurricane María in 2017. The island’s population declined more than 11 percent from 2010 to 2020. For the mayoral hopeful in Juncos, this is why more than half of the town's eligible voters abstained from participating in the mayoral election in 2020. </p>

            <p>The party's growing presence can be felt on the ballot. In 2020, the right-wing party debuted with 29 candidates running for positions including the governor, mayor, local Senate, and House seats. </p>

            <p>Four years later, that number has spiked to 421 candidates running for mayor, senators and representatives.</p>

            <p>The emergence of Proyecto Dignidad reflects broader trends of populism, nationalism, and anti-establishment sentiment observed in Latin America and globally, with each movement taking strategies from Donald Trump's playbook and adapting to its country's specific context and challenges. Trump, who won the votes of about eight in 10 white evangelicals in 2016, embraces Christianity as a cultural identity, and promises to defend it. </p>

          <div class="col-12 col-md-8 col-lg-6">
            <p>The twice-divorced former president hasn’t been shy about boasting how he shaped the Supreme Court’s conservative supermajority. Last summer, he appeared at a Faith & Freedom Coalition gala in Washington calling himself a crusader for the Christian right, reminding the crowd how he overturned Roe v. Wade. This enticement goes beyond the continental U.S.  </p>
            
            <p>If elected in November, members of Proyecto Dignidad aim to criminalize women who perform or consent to an abortion, remove vaccination requirements at public schools, and defend “conversion therapy” for LGBTQ people. As part of their “Declaration of Principles,” Proyecto Dignidad includes promoting and establishing as priorities “the family, life from fertilization to its natural termination” and basing their “trust in the Almighty God who is the source of dignity and who imparts it to every human being.”</p>

            <p>Traditionally a two-party system, Puerto Rico's political discourse was disrupted when a non-elected fiscal control board, imposed by former President Barack Obama, eroded the island's autonomy after declaring municipal bankruptcy (the largest in U.S. history). About a year later, Hurricane Maria devastated the island, causing enduring issues like a fragile power grid and frequent outages, aggravated by the pandemic and austerity measures. </p>

            <p>Corruption, Puerto Rico’s much too often plague du jour, was pronounced most acutely in 2019, when the island garnered international attention after thousands of protesters demonstrated in the streets of San Juan calling for the resignation of former governor Ricardo Rosselló. It doesn’t help that six mayors from both statehood and status quo parties have been arrested by the FBI since the 2020 elections, while others face local charges. Amidst this turmoil, Proyecto Dignidad, a conservative party, was born. </p>

            <p>But Proyecto Dignidad didn’t emerge overnight. </p>

            <p><b>Growing Support</b></p>
            <p>The traditional party advocating for statehood, the New Progressive Party (PNP, in Spanish), has historically attracted religious sectors on the island. </p>
            
            <p>For instance, consider the "religious liberty bill" proposed by the ousted former governor Ricardo Rosselló in 2019, which sought to exempt government employees from serving constituents if their religious beliefs clashed. </p>
            
            <p>International superstar Ricky Martin, a Puerto Rican native, had to write a letter to garner national support, attracting figures like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, eventually leading to the bill's demise. Still, a substantial number of people on the island supported the bill—individuals whom Proyecto Dignidad is now reaching out to.</p>
            
            <p>In the 2020 elections, Proyecto Dignidad unexpectedly secured two conservative female lawmakers, focusing on anti-abortion, anti-gender education, and anti-street harassment policies. Joanne Rodríguez Veve, a senator under Proyecto Dignidad, not only secured a seat in the last elections, but she also came in second for the candidate with the most votes across the island. </p>
            
            <p>Four years later, the party is substantially much stronger and plans to secure even more spots in government by backing conservative causes. </p>
            
            <p>Proyecto Dignidad, along with its progressive counterpart Movimiento Victoria Ciudadana or the Citizens’ Victory Movement, has been resonating with voters by focusing on rebuilding Puerto Rico and offering a vision for the future that appeals to young people, moving away from the statehood question. </p>
            
            <p>Political parties on the island differ slightly from those in the U.S., where democrats are seen as progressive and republicans as conservatives. </p>
            
            <p>In Puerto Rico, political alignments revolve around beliefs about whether the island should be a state or not. </p>
            
            <p>“Amidst a scenario of economic erosion, as well as the weakening of traditional political parties that have remained in power, Proyecto Dignidad and Movimiento Victoria Ciudadana start to emerge,” said Juan Caraballo Resto, an anthropology professor at the University of Puerto Rico who focuses on the intersection of religion and politics. </p>
            
            <p>Proyecto Dignidad saw a ninefold surge in donations their second time around, raising over $51,191 by mid-April since the start of the year, a hefty jump from the $13,192 they garnered by the same period in 2020, during their initial debut. Donations are coming in from folks in Puerto Rico, but money is also piling up thanks to supporters in the mainland U.S. Since 2021, the party has gathered more than $1.6 million. </p>
            
            <p>A recent poll conducted by the main newspaper, El Nuevo Día, captured the party’s reach. When asked about their expectations for the performance of third parties in the upcoming November elections, 78 percent of respondents expressed confidence in their ability to make a significant impact. Another poll shows an increase in favorability for Proyecto Dignidad from Nov. 2023 to March 2024 from 40 percent to 48 percent.</p>

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/17658519" data-width="50%"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
            
            <p>“For many years now, religiously conservative coalitions have been closely linked to a group of legislators, mayors, and leaders who have tried to lobby for bills," Caraballo Resto said. “Proyecto Dignidad is the result of a historical evolution raised by religious leaders, their interests, and conservative Christians on the island.”   </p>
            
            <p>One potential success for Proyecto Dignidad could be in San Sebastián, a rural northwestern town, where they might secure their first mayoral seat. Javier Jiménez, the current mayor, disaffiliated from the traditional party advocating for statehood, and is now running for governor under Proyecto Dignidad’s banner.  </p>
            
            <p>His endorsement of the mayoral candidate aligned with Proyecto Dignidad is likely to have a significant impact.  </p>
            
            <p>Jiménez gained recognition for swiftly restoring power to San Sebastian after Hurricane Maria amid FEMA’s slow response. He mobilized a task force named the “Pepino Power Authority,” after the city’s official name, San Sebastián de las Vegas del Pepino.   </p>
            
            <p>He reassigned 32 licensed electricians from the town’s workforce for the Pepino Power Authority. Instead of applause, he faced accusations from The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority of circumventing its monopoly. FEMA later released a public statement applauding his efforts, reminding Puerto Ricans two months after the natural disaster that “You are the help until help arrives.”  </p>
            
            <p>“The government didn’t do its job,” Jiménez said while sitting on a bench in San Sebastian’s plaza.   </p>
            
            <p>That was a pivotal moment for Jiménez.   </p>
            
            <p>He grew distrustful of his own party, despising the direction the education system was taking with gender perspective, as well as mask mandates following the pandemic, the right to abortion, and a slew of other beliefs.  </p>
            
            <p>“The PNP has distanced itself from its principles and the value for life that I treasure,” he said.  </p>
            
             <p>He made the switch, although his chances of winning for governor under Proyecto Dignidad were slim. Still, his influence is certain to leave a mark, particularly considering the recent 37 percent slump in new voter registrations reported in February compared to the same period in the previous election year.   </p>
            
             <p>The PNP has lost members amid the emergence of parties like Proyecto Dignidad and the Movimento Victoria Ciudadana party, which supports a constitutional assembly to determine Puerto Rico’s status. (In a desperate attempt to get them back, the current governor running for reëlection under the PNP said in a meeting filled with public sector employees that “like the parable of the gifts, God has given me abilities and aptitudes, a way of being and opportunities. I make it clear here, to all progressive servants, to the people in general, I am going to use all those skills.”)  </p>
            
             <p>Although these two emerging parties are seen as each other’s alter-egos to some extent, they recently banded together after a lawsuit brought forth by the pro-status quo party successfully excluded certain candidates from Proyecto Dignidad and the Movimento Victoria Ciudadana from the upcoming November elections.  </p>
            
             <p>The lawsuit alleges that these candidates failed to gather the required signatures to qualify as electoral candidates, as mandated by the Electoral Code, but the government hopefuls appealed, saying that the code states that if a party chooses to use an alternate method to choose their candidate, they do not need to collect signatures.  </p>
            
             <p>"The ruling is detrimental to democracy and our nation," said Manuel Natal, a coordinator for the Movimento Victoria Ciudadana and a mayoral candidate in San Juan, the day following the judgment. The MVC had opted for an alternative method to select their candidates, and Proyecto Dignidad claims it wasn’t a defendant in the lawsuit.  </p>
             <p>Just like the pro-statehood party, the pro-status quo party has been floundering to garner votes.   </p>
             <p>Camilo Ortiz, once the pro-statehood New Progressive Party’s vice president, announced his departure from the party and his candidacy for mayor of San Sebastián under Proyecto Dignidad. He garnered the support of Jiménez, one of Puerto Rico’s most popular mayors.  </p>
             <p>“We need to put the house in order,” Jiménez said. “Until we do that, we can’t aspire for any change in our status.” 
  </p>
             <p>Arzuaga López in Juncos also believes Puerto Rico's problems stem from home. 
  </p>
             <p>Reflecting on her childhood in an area without basic amenities like paved roads and potable water, she saw the importance of growing up in a strong religious community, where she was “taught what was right.” 
  </p>
             <p>One strong point of contention in her home was between her mother and father: their political parties. Statehood or commonwealth? When she came of age, Arzuaga López started voting for the PPD party, advocating for the status quo, because of a reason all-too-common in Puerto Rico. 
  </p>
             <p>“My mother voted PPD, and my grandma voted PPD,” she giggled. She then switched to the pro-statehood party, influenced by her father.  
  </p>
             <p>But as Arzuaga López grew up, and started volunteering with her church in Juncos, she felt something in Puerto Rico’s youth was amiss, and the parties she once supported were failing to address it. Puerto Ricans were missing values, the mayoral hopeful said. 
  </p>
             <p>The same generations bearing the results of imposed austerity measures, government mismanagement after natural disasters, and a $9.5o minimum wage.
  </p>
            <p>“We need to orient our parents with our guidance,” Arzuaga López said. “We can involve the community, including churches,” she added, “and sometimes people don’t know what they have to offer, but when they search for them, they find out.”
